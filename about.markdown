Hi! My name is John!

> Specialized in building interactive prototypes in JS, HTML5

Recently I worked as a software engineer at <ins>Twenty Media</ins> (a concise summaries media startup that provides information for students in their twenties).

Before joining Twenty, I co-founded <ins>Code for Designers</ins> (a community that teaches code for graphic designers) and I helped teach front-end code to Korean graphic designers in order to help develop their working relationship with software engineers.
